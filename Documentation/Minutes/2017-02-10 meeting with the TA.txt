User Story: for the entire project (used to define the entire requirements of entirety)
- functional and nonfunctional

 Notes Burndown chart for entire scope of the project
  
 Individual workload/task breakdown has to be all on the Trello which then HAS to be uploaded on Github. Tasks lists of all the task done for sprint 2 broke down into who did what.
 
 Have a plan for the design (test cases for this, another test for something else, etc)
 
 Add a component where the ta has a "report". I.E. where he can see the progress of the student.
 
 Each tasks has a short description of what it should do and how we would implement it. Have a "development" plan for future weeks (from sprint 2 to 3)
 
 Progres on setting up Travis CI
