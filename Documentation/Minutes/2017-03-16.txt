Present (through Discord): Adam, Caldia, Darrin, Ekaterina, Emerald, Joseph, Loic, Phuong-Thao

Discussed:

- How to seperate each level.
 - Level 1: Student will be required to move the character forward (until he arrives at the end point)
 - Level 2: Students will use a for loop to avoid repeadting the same forward call
 - Level 3: Student will use a for loop to determine the number of times the avatar should move in a certani direction

TODO: 
- Work on the implementation of the game.
- Create levels.
